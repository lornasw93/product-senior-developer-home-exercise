## Notes
I've created a small person manager application that has basic functionality to add, edit and view persons. The application is pretty responsive. Having had more time, I would have enhanced the application with more features like deleting a person, search, pagination, and more. I also would have ensured that the left hand panel list of persons was reactive upon changing the data in the right hand panel. I would have also added more unit tests to the application. I would have also liked to enhanced both UI and logging in the backend too. I kept in the home component as utilised it as the first page a user will come on to, added a page not found component and then a few related ones in regards to persons/people.
